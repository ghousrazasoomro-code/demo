&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Guru had undergone torture on the orders of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, at a site in Lahore's walled city that is commemorated by the defunct Gurdwara Lal Khoohi - which has been repurposed into a Muslim shrine by the name of Haq Chaar Yaar. The Guru's torture infuriated his close friend and Muslim mystic, Mian Mir. On the fifth day of torture, the Guru's request for a bath in the river was granted after intercession from Mian Mir.[3] After submerging himself in the river, the Guru reportedly did not reappear, and a Mughal search party was unable to retrieve him.
The Guru's son and successor, Guru Hargobind had a memorial built here in 1619. The main Gurudwara building with gilded dome was built during Maharaja Ranjit Singh's reign, while some other additions were made later up until the partition.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBhagat Kanwar Ram (1885 – 1939) was a Sindhi Sufi singer and poet.

Kanwar Ram was born to Tarachand Morira and Tirath Bai on 13 April 1885 in the Jarwar village of Sukkur (Sakhar) district in Sind, British India. He was assassinated by religious extremists at the Ruk railway station in the Sukkur district in November 1939. He was popular among both Hindu and Muslim Sindhi communities of Sindh. 
Bhagat Kanwarram, an Indian Sindhi-language film on the poet's life directed by Dharam Kumar released in 1952. Commemorative stamp was issued by Indian President Pratibha Patil on 26 April 2010.
Bhagat KAnwarram Great Sant of SINDH
Great Saint of Sindh:
Bhagat Kanwarram
Bhagat Kanwar Ram was born in small village called (Ddaherki) Jarvaran Taluka
Mirpur Mathelo, District Sukkur, in 1885 A.D.
Sant Kanwar Ram was not only popular amongst the Sindhi Hindus but also with
the Muslims. His father, Tarachand,who had a shop of general merchandise, entrusted him to the care and tutelage of his Guru-Saint Satramdas.
Sometimes, Kanwar Ram would help his father and brother in the shop, and sometimes he would till the land.
However after Kanwar Ram's Guru passed on in 1917 AD, young Kanwar moved and
stayed in his guru's place.
Bhagat Kanwar Ram recited 'Gurbani' i.e. Shlokas from Guru Granth Sahib (The
Sacred book of the Sikhs). He was a humble, generous and compassionate man. He
wore a long kurta and a red head gear. He sang and danced at Bhagats. Though
he had not trained his voice, it was magical.
Sant Kanwar Ram was renowned for his rendition of the Sur Prabhati (generally
sung early in the morning). The record company HMV made 10 records preserving
20 of the saint's musical renditions. These became extremely popular in Sindh.
The money that Bhagat Kanwar Ram would collect would be distributed to the needy.
Let me tell you what a 'Bhagat' is.

Bhagat is what the lead singer is called.and the Bhagat is also what is considered
as a very popular art form of 'Sindhi song and dance.
It required at least two performers, as the performance was interactive. Some
were good singers, the others peechhads or boliaraas (Back up singers). The back up singers sometimes dressed up as women.
One of the important miracles connected with Sant Kanwar Ram was that he brought back a dead child to life. While the saint sang and danced, it was his habit to sing a (Lori) lullaby to the children. He used to pray to God to bless the child in his arms.
One day, Bhagat Sahib visited a small town for performing a bhagat in the evening. On the same day, the only child of a poor widow had died. She was totally shattered. She knew that the great saint bhagat Kanwaram would be performing in the evening. The Saint used to sing lullabies (loris) to the children. The mother wrapped the child in a cloth and went to the bhagat. She handed over the child into the hands of Bhagat Kanwaram. He blessed the child and started singing loris.He realized that the child that he had just blessed was dead; The Saint criedout to God.
